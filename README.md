# Profile Status

Profile Status is a set of SourceMod Plugins designed to restrict player entrance based on a variety of data obtained through the Steam API, such as game hours, account age, Steam level and more. <br>
It is built on top of the [Player Info](https://github.com/maxijabase/sm-playerinfo) library.

Currently the following modules have been **added** or **rewritten from v2**:

- Account Age Checker
- ~~Game Hours Checker~~
- ~~Steam Level Checker~~
- ~~Bans Checker~~ (VAC, Game, Economy and Community bans)
- ~~Profile Privacy Checker~~
