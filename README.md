# Profile Status

Profile Status is a SourceMod plugin designed to restrict entrance to any Source based game server based on game hours, Steam bans, Steam levels and more.

## Installation

**1-** Download the zip file in Releases and drag its contents into your **/addons/sourcemod/** folder.</br>
**2-** If you're using a custom database, make sure to add it in **/addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg** by creating a new entry, and using that name in the plugin's cvar. Otherwise, there is no need to change this cvar.</br>
**3-** Start your server so the plugin creates the config file, in **/cfg/sourcemod/ProfileStatus.cfg**</br>
**4-** Set up the requirements in the config file and restart the server.
